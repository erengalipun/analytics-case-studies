# Analytics Case Studies

This repository contains a growing collection of data analytics projects
focused on problem-solving, hypothesis-driven analysis, and clear storytelling.

Each folder represents an independent case study built around a specific
business or operational question, using real-world analytical workflows.

Projects are documented individually with their own datasets, queries,
and insights.
