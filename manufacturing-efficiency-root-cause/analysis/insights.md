# Key Findings – Manufacturing Efficiency Analysis

- Low-efficiency jobs account for the majority of production tasks.
- Schedule delay is the strongest driver of low production efficiency.
- Energy consumption and machine usage show no strong correlation with efficiency levels.

## 1. Problem Context
The objective of this analysis was to identify the primary drivers of low
production efficiency within a hybrid manufacturing environment and
distinguish between surface-level symptoms and true root causes.

## 2. Initial Observations
- A significant portion of production jobs fall into the low-efficiency category.
- Processing time and energy consumption show limited variance across efficiency levels.
- Machine and operation distributions appear relatively balanced.

These early observations suggested that commonly assumed performance
metrics alone were insufficient to explain efficiency loss.

## 3. Hypothesis Elimination
Multiple potential drivers were evaluated and systematically deprioritized:

- **Processing Time:** Differences across efficiency categories were marginal and inconsistent.
- **Energy Consumption:** Higher energy usage did not reliably correspond to lower efficiency.
- **Machine or Operation Bias:** Workload distribution remained balanced across machines and operation types.

As a result, these factors were ruled out as primary drivers of inefficiency.

## 4. Root Cause Identification
Schedule delay emerged as the dominant factor influencing production efficiency.

Low-efficiency jobs consistently experienced significantly higher average
delays between scheduled and actual completion times compared to
high-efficiency jobs.

This relationship remained stable even when controlling for machine and
operation type, strengthening the conclusion that scheduling issues are
systemic rather than localized.

## 5. Business Implication
Production inefficiency in this system is primarily driven by schedule
adherence issues rather than machine performance or energy usage.

This indicates that operational planning and execution discipline have a
greater impact on efficiency outcomes than hardware-level optimizations.

## 6. Recommendation
- Prioritize improvements in production scheduling accuracy and execution control.
- Implement early-warning indicators to detect and mitigate delay propagation.
- Re-evaluate planning assumptions and buffer strategies for low-efficiency jobs.
